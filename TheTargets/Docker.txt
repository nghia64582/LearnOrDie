    + docker run: Run a container.
    + docker ps: List running containers.
    + docker images: List Docker images.
    + docker pull: Download images from Docker Hub.
    + docker stop/rm: Stop and remove containers.
    + docker rmi: Remove Docker images.
- Working with Docker Images:
    + Understanding Docker Hub.
    + Pulling and running pre-built images.
    + Understanding image layers.
- Basic Dockerfiles:
    + Create simple Dockerfiles.
    + Understanding FROM, RUN, CMD, ENTRYPOINT.
    + docker build command.
- Simple Volume Mounting:
    + Understanding the basics of persisting data with volumes.

*** STAGE 2: Docker Networking and Volumes (Intermediate)

- Docker Networking:
    + Understanding Docker network drivers (bridge, host, overlay).
    + Creating custom networks.
    + Container communication.
    + Exposing ports.
- Advanced Docker Volumes:
    + Named volumes vs. bind mounts.
    + Managing volume lifecycles.
    + Data persistence strategies.
- Docker Compose:
    + Understanding Docker Compose for multi-container applications.
    + Creating docker-compose.yml files.
    + docker-compose up/down.
    + Understanding dependencies and linking containers.
- Dockerfile Best Practices:
    + Optimizing Dockerfile size.
    + Using .dockerignore.
    + Security best practices.
    + Multi-stage builds.
- Docker Logs and Inspection:
    + docker logs: View container logs.
    + docker inspect: Inspect container and image details.

*** STAGE 3: Docker Orchestration and Advanced Concepts (Advanced)
- Docker Swarm (or Kubernetes):
    + Understanding container orchestration.
    + Setting up a Docker Swarm cluster.
    + Deploying services in Swarm.
    + Or, Kubernetes. Kubernetes has become the industry standard.
- Docker Security:
    + Docker security best practices.
    + Image scanning and vulnerability management.
    + User namespaces and security profiles.
- Docker Registry:
    + Setting up a private Docker registry.
    + Pushing and pulling images to/from the registry.
- Docker CI/CD Integration:
    + Integrating Docker with CI/CD pipelines (e.g., Jenkins, GitLab CI, GitHub Actions).
    + Automating Docker image builds and deployments.
- Docker Monitoring and Logging:
    + Monitoring Docker container performance.
    + Centralized logging with tools like ELK stack or Grafana Loki.
- Docker Storage Drivers:
    + Understanding the different storage drivers.
- Docker in Cloud Environments:
    + Deploying Docker containers on cloud platforms (AWS ECS, Azure Container Instances, Google Cloud Run).

*** STAGE 4: Advanced Orchestration (Expert)

- Kubernetes Deep Dive:
    + Pods, deployments, services, namespaces.
    + ConfigMaps and Secrets.
    + Ingress controllers.
    + Helm charts.
    + Operators.
- Service Meshes:
    + Understanding service meshes (e.g., Istio, Linkerd).
    + Implementing service meshes for microservices.
- Advanced CI/CD with Kubernetes:
    + GitOps.
    + Advanced deployment strategies (Canary, Blue/Green).
- Serverless Containerization:
    + Understanding serverless container platforms.
    + Deploying serverless containers.
