*** STAGE 1: Docker Fundamentals (Beginner)

- Understanding Containerization: 90
    + What is containerization?
    + Why use Docker?
    + Virtual machines vs. containers.
- Docker Installation: 90
    + Install Docker Desktop (Windows/macOS) or Docker Engine (Linux).
    + Verify installation.

- Docker concept: 
    + Docker Image:
        + A blueprint of docker container
        + Template to build docker container
        + Created from Dockerfile
        + Store in docker hub/ registry
        + Command:
            + docker pull <image>	            Download an image from Docker Hub.
            + docker images	                    List all downloaded images.
            + docker rmi <image>	            Remove an image.
            + docker tag <image> <repo>:<tag>	Tag an image for pushing to a registry.
            + docker push <repo>:<tag>	        Push an image to a registry.
            + docker build -t myapp .	        Build an image from a Dockerfile.

    + Docker Container:
        + Isolated runtime enviroments created from image
        + Run application across different enviroments
        + Can be started, stopped, restarted and removed
        + Command:
            + docker ps	                                    List running containers.
            + docker ps -a	                                List all containers (including stopped ones).
            + docker run -d --name myapp -p 8080:80 nginx	Run a container in detached mode.
            + docker start <container>	                    Start a stopped container.
            + docker stop <container>	                    Stop a running container.
            + docker restart <container>	                Restart a container.
            + docker rm <container>	                        Remove a container.
            + docker logs -f <container>	                View real-time logs of a container.

    + Docker Hub/ Registry:
        + A place to store and distribute docker image
        + Public registry: hub.docker.com
        + Command:
            + docker push <repo>:<tag>	        Push an image to a registry.
            + docker tag <image> <repo>:<tag>	Tag an image for pushing to a registry.
            + docker pull <image>	            Download an image from Docker Hub.

    + Dockerfile :
        + Script to define how to build an image
        + Example : 
            # Use an official JDK as base image
            FROM eclipse-temurin:17-jdk-alpine

            # Set working directory
            WORKDIR /app

            # Copy the Maven wrapper files and POM to leverage caching
            COPY mvnw pom.xml ./
            COPY .mvn .mvn

            # Download dependencies before copying source code for better caching
            RUN ./mvnw dependency:go-offline

            # Copy the entire project
            COPY . .

            # Build the application
            RUN ./mvnw clean package -DskipTests

            # Run the Spring Boot app
            CMD ["java", "-jar", "target/your-app.jar"]

    + Docker Compose :
        + A tool for managing multi-container applications.
        + Uses a docker-compose.yml file to define services.
        + Command:
            + docker-compose up -d	        Start all services in docker-compose.yml.
            + docker-compose down	        Stop and remove all services.
            + docker-compose ps	            List running services.
            + docker-compose logs -f        View logs of all services.
            + docker-compose build	        Build images for all services.

    + Docker Volume:
        + A persistent storage mechanism for containers.
        + Prevents data loss when containers restart.
        + Mounted into a container at a specific path.
        + Command: 
            + docker volume create my-data
            + docker run -d -v my-data:/app/data my-app
