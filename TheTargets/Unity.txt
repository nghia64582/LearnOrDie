✅ Install Unity Hub & Unity Editor (Latest LTS version recommended)
✅ Understand Unity Interface (Scene, Game, Hierarchy, Inspector, Project, Console)
✅ GameObjects & Components (Everything in Unity is a GameObject with Components)
✅ Navigating the Scene & Using the Gizmos

👉 Project Idea: Create a simple 2D or 3D scene with basic objects (Cubes, Spheres).

2️⃣ C# Scripting in Unity
✅ Basic C# Concepts (Variables, Methods, Loops, Conditions, Arrays, Lists)
✅ Unity-Specific Methods:

Start() – Runs once at the beginning
Update() – Runs every frame
FixedUpdate() – Runs for physics updates
✅ Understanding MonoBehaviour & GameObject Methods:
gameObject.SetActive(true/false);
Destroy(gameObject);
Instantiate(prefab, position, rotation);
✅ Input Handling (Keyboard, Mouse, Touch)
✅ Coroutines (IEnumerator) – Used for delays & animations
👉 Mini Project: Create a basic player controller that moves using keyboard input.

- Unity Physics & Collisions
    + Rigidbodies & Colliders (BoxCollider, SphereCollider, MeshCollider)
    + Collision Detection (OnCollisionEnter, OnTriggerEnter)
    + Forces & Gravity (Rigidbody.AddForce())

👉 Mini Project: Make a bouncing ball simulation with physics.

- UI & User Interaction
    + Canvas, Buttons, Text, Images
    + Handling UI Clicks (Button.onClick.AddListener())
    + HUD (Health Bar, Score Counter, Timer)

👉 Mini Project: Create a simple main menu with Start & Quit buttons.

- GameObjects & Prefabs
    + What is a Prefab? (Reusable GameObjects)
    + Instantiating Prefabs (Instantiate(prefab, position, rotation))
    + Destroying GameObjects (Destroy(gameObject))

👉 Mini Project: Spawn enemies at random positions using prefabs.

- Animations & Effects
    + Unity Animator (State Machine & Transitions)
    + Particle System (Fire, Smoke, Explosions)
    + Sound Effects & Background Music (AudioSource)

👉 Mini Project: Animate a character walking & jumping.

- Game AI & NPCs
    + Basic AI Movement (NavMeshAgent)
    + Enemy Behavior (Chase, Patrol, Attack)
    + Finite State Machines (FSM) for AI

👉 Mini Project: Create a basic enemy that chases the player.

- Saving & Loading Game Data
    + PlayerPrefs (Simple Data Storage)
    + Saving Data to JSON or a Database
    + Checkpoints & Save Systems

👉 Mini Project: Add a high score system that saves player progress.

9️⃣ Optimizing Your Game
    + Object Pooling (Instead of Instantiating & Destroying Repeatedly)
    + Level Streaming (Loading Scenes Efficiently)
    + Reducing Draw Calls & Performance Tuning

🔟 Publishing Your Game
    + Building for PC, Mobile, or Web
    + Testing & Debugging (Unity Profiler, Debug.Log)
    + Uploading to Google Play, App Store, or Steam
