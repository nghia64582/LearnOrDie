- One Tool to manage all auto scenarios (CRUD scenarios, perform scenarios)
- Each scenario has multiple steps
- Each step could be one of these types:
 + Wait for an image to appear
 + Click into one image in a zone (defined by a rectangle)
 + Type a word/button
- The bot can jump from one step to another
- We can start the scenario at a specific step, not alway at step 1
